                            and family, but you’re also swamped with content from strangers.
                            <br><br>
                            Momo aims to change this by creating a sharable photo album experience exclusively for your
                            closest family and friends, ensuring you interact only with your inner circle.
                            <br><br>
                            With only a small team of 4 developers and no designers, Trinity Studios knew that they
                            needed a revamp of Momo in order for it to stand out amoungst other social sharing
                            platforms.

            <h1 class="project-section-title">🤔 Problem</h1>
            <p>Momo started out as a digital photo album, but it needed a redesign. Bryan Edward Armijos, the owner of
                Trinity Studios, wanted to create a welcoming and lively social platform with an interactive UI. He
                reached out to me with the task of redesigning the current UI that they had built into a better UI that
                also respects UX design principles.

            <div class="problem-statement-wrapper">

                <p>Some possible challenges that I would've encountered with this project were:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Small Team: </b>The team consisted of only 4 developers and I was the only designer</li>
                    <li><b>Tight Deadline: </b>Bryan wanted a final, complete redesign of the feed, message page, and
                        comment
                        section by the end of December</li>
                    <li><b>Conflicting Schedules: </b>The dev team only had availability during the evening due to their
                        full-time
                        roles during the day and I only had certain evenings available during the week due to my school
                        schedule</li>

                <h2>Understanding Client Needs</h2>
                <p>Bryan specified that he'd like <b>a complete redesign of the main features & screens of his app</b>,
                    however, he told me
                    upfront that <b>he wasn't sure what he wanted the new UI of his app to look like.</b>
                </p>

            <div class="setting-up-workspace-section">
                <h2>Setting Up the Workspace</h2>
                <p>Because of our conflicting schedules, we only had 1 evening per week that we could hop on a call and
                    talk
                    about our progress.
                    Bryan suggested we used Confluence and Slack to upload my design progress with comments and to
                    schedule
                    our meeting time and to keep him in the loop.</p>
                <p>After our initial meeting, I proposed to him what services I could offer for his dilemma, I was going
                    to
                    provide him with moodboards, sketches, wireframes, and a final prototype throughout the next few
                    months.
                    We also came up with a rough timeline of when he wanted these screens to be done:</p>

                        and removed

                        <ul>
                            <li>It lacked a navbar at the bottom for icons indicating the different screens</li>
                            <li>There were little to no indications of the status of certain interactions (aka, no way
                                of
                                telling
                                the user if they've got notifications, a viewed/unviewed story, etc.)</li>
                            <li>The overall design was lacking in branded colors and features</li>

                    <h2>Ideas Loading...</h2>
                    <p>After reviewing my notes, Bryan and the rest of the team initially decided that I should <b>focus
                            on
                            only
                            redesigning 3 main screens: the Feed, the Comments section, and the Messages Screen.</b></p>
                    <p>He also encouraged that I <b>create a new feature</b> that could be implemented within the
                        limitations of
                        the
                        small dev team that will make the app stand out.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>A Lot of Sketching</h3>
                <p>For the next 4 months, I got to sketching the screens. Because
                    of
                    the time crunch, we agreed to start sketching all of the screens within the first month:</p>

                    <p>With the sketches being approved by Bryan and the dev team, I got to work designing the wireframe
                        of
                        the
                        prototype on Figma. Reason being that we needed to establish and agree on what the margins,
                        content
                        placement, and font sizing would look like:</p>

                        <img src="images/Momo/Momo-Figma-LoWi.png" class="timeline-resize">

                    <div class="caption">First stage of the wireframing of Momo.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="figma-section-2">
                    <p>Once approved of the designs, I further expanded on the wireframe to gauge what his thoughts were
                        on
                        the
                        features so far:</p>

                        <img src="images/Momo/Momo-Figma-MidFi.png" class="timeline-resize">
                    </a>
                    <div class="caption">Second stage of the wireframing of Momo.</div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>A Roadblock</h2>
            <p>While designing the app with the branded colors and features, Bryan let me know that
                the "Reactions" feature was not feasible for the dev team,
                they
                tried to implement it in the code but it was causing them problems and bugs. This started to slow
                down
                the development process and we only had 2 months left to push out a beta version of this app. <b>He
                    asked
                    if I could reconsider another design for
                    this feature that had the same functionality but was more feasible for the dev team to code.</b></p>

            <p>Which is why, after much brainstorming, I came up with a reworked design for the Reactions feature:
            </p>
            <a href="images/Momo/Momo-NewReactions.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
                <img src="images/Momo/Momo-NewReactions.png" class="timeline-resize">
            </a>
            <div class="caption">Second stage of the wireframing of Momo.</div>
            <p>After showing it to Bryan, he approved of it!</p>

            <div class="final-prototype-section">
                <p>And with that, the prototype was finally completed:</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="results">
            <h1 class="project-section-title">✨ Results</h1>
            <h2>Beta Launch</h2>
            <p>The beta launch went great! It was my first beta launch of an app and it was interesting to see how users
                reacted to the
                initial concept of Momo. I recieved a lot of feedback on the initial beta design, some users saying they
                enjoyed the unique features and colors, others provided helpful critiques on the overall user flow of
                the app.
            </p>
            <p>Despite the successful beta test, we weren't able to properly launch the app due to budget constraints,
                but that
                didn't diminish our accomplishments from this project, and we all walked away with lessons and skills
                learned.

        <section id="reflection">
            <h1 class="project-section-title">🧘🏻‍♀️ Reflection</h1>
            <p>This was my first time working directly with a client and a dev team, it was really fun and educational!
                Here's what I learned from this experience:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I learned how to use new team and project management softwares like Confluence,</li>
                <li>How to effectively communicate with clients and team members whenever there were
                    disagreements on a design and</li>
                <li>How beta testing works with iOS products on the backend.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, if I could go back in time and change some things, here's what I'd do differently:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn more about the capabilities and limitations of Swift.js so I can better understand and
                    empathize with future software developers</li>
                <li>Spend more time on the final design than on a second version of wireframing if there's a time crunch
                </li>
                <li>Understand that while working with limitations, you're not expected to follow all the steps of a
                    design process, just learn how to adapt and choose which part of the process will get you the best
                    results for you and your team</li>
            </ul>
