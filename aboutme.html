            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>Ever since I was a kid, I loved traditional art like painting with acrylics and watercolor. That
                passion carried with me throughout
                high school. During my time at high school, I was unsure of what I wanted my future to look like, I
                knew I wanted to do something creative but I didn't want it to just be traditional art. It was
                during my sophomore year when I had to take a photography class as an elective
                that I started using Adobe Photoshop
                and immediately fell in love with it.
            </p>
            <p>From my sophomore year up until now, I've been exploring digital design of all forms, first starting
                out with photoshopping images,
                to working with Adobe After Effects to make silly animations in my free time, to discovering a
                hidden passion for coding and web design during college.
            </p>
            <p>It was also during the pandemic and my sophomore year of college that I started to explore the web
                design field a bit more and started to become interested in UX Design. I
                joined online courses provided by my college and other CUNY schools to further explore UX and its
                coorelation with coding,
                and the rest was history.
            </p>
            <p>I spent the first year freelancing as a UX researcher and designer for small startups as well as
                joining web design and digital product competitions to further my skills. With my experience working
                in freelance, I was soon able to intern at Mastercard!
            </p>
            <p>I'm now finishing my last semester of college and am going to venture out into the world as a junior
                UX researcher and designer and front-end web developer!
