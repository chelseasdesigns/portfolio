                    <h3>Desk Research</h3>
                    <p>I conducted extensive desk research, which involved:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reviewing legal documents to understand what is considered inaccessible according to US

                    <h3>Collaboration & Engagement</h3>
                    <p>We worked closely with an external research group that specialized in accessibility within user
                        experience research to deepen our understanding of accessible research methods and to integrate
                        their findings into our ongoing slide deck.

                        guide.
                        This
                        guide was then presented to researchers, designers, developers,
                        and project managers at Mastercard as a reference point for future user research.</li>

                concepts
                and
                ensure alignment with user needs.

                        ability to
                        communicate complex topics effectively to a large audience and increased awareness of accessible

            <h1 class="project-section-title">üí≠ Takeaways</h2>
                <p>I learned more in the three months working at Mastercard than in the previous year of working
                    freelance
                    and
                    studying user experience research. This internship was incredibly educational and significantly
                    enhanced
                    my
                    professional skills. Some impactful skills and lessons I learned from Mastercard and have applied to
                    my
                    previous
                    projects
                    and clients are:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Empathy and Patience in User Interviews: </b>I learned to show compassion and patience when
                        interviewing users,
                        ensuring they feel comfortable and heard. This approach not only builds trust but also leads to
                        richer,
                        more
                        insightful data. I also gained confidence in asking follow-up questions to delve deeper into
                        user
                        responses
                        and understand their needs better.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Effective Presentation of Research Findings: </b>I developed skills in presenting research
                        findings
                        in an
                        engaging and compelling manner to stakeholders. This involves tailoring the presentation to the
                        audience,
                        highlighting key insights, and demonstrating the practical implications of the research.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Non-Linear Research Process: </b> I came to understand that the research process is not
                        always
                        linear.
                        Flexibility and adaptability are crucial, as research often requires revisiting and revising
                        previous
                        steps
                        based on new insights or challenges.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Analyzing Quantitative and Qualitative Data: </b> I improved my ability to analyze both
                        quantitative
                        and
                        qualitative data, recognizing the value in each and learning how to identify and interpret
                        trends.
                        This
                        skill
                        has been essential in providing comprehensive insights and making data-driven decisions.

                        user researcher.
