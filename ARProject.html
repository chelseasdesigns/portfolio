                        sustainable options. The NYC
                        Fair
                        Trade Coalition addresses this by offering thrifted clothing at affordable prices and

                        clothing

                        <br>
                        However, discovering sustainable stores is challenging, as they are often not
                        well-advertised. Mainstream brands lack transparency, leaving shoppers uncertain about their
                        purchases'
                        sustainability. There is also a knowledge gap in understanding sustainability in fashion, making
                        informed choices difficult for consumers.

            <p>I had to understand <b>what in the fashion industry is harming the environment</b>, and the target users

                    <h3>Desk Research</h3>
                    <p>I found that fast fashion, driven by social media trends, significantly contributes to global
                        warming due to <b>carbon emissions</b> and <b>excessive water usage</b> in mass production.
                        Additionally, the
                        mass
                        production of clothing leads to <b>less durable garments</b>, decreasing their lifespan and
                        contributing to
                        increased waste.</p>

                    <p>To gather insights, I conducted a >5 minute survey targeting U.S.
                        residents via Google Forms, distributed on platforms like Reddit and Discord. The aim was to
                        grasp
                        <b>the sustainable shopping experience</b> for <b>both seasoned eco-shoppers and newcomers</b>,

                    <p>Most respondents are not confident in identifying if a piece of
                        clothing is made sustainably due to a lack of knowledge on where to find manufacturing
                        information online and what to look out for.</p>

            <h2>Ideating</h2>
            <p>With my new findings, I decided to keep the following in mind while thinking of what the mobile product
                should include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide only essential information on the carbon emissions and water usage involved in the
                    manufacturing process of clothing as well as the clothing’s estimated lifespan</li>
                <li>Design a simple, user-friendly interface to ensure accessibility for first-time users</li>
                <li>Address and mitigate the trust issues users have with sustainability information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And with that I got to sketching:</p>
            <a href="images/greencotton-first-sketch.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery">
                <img src="images/greencotton/greencotton-first-sketch.jpg" class="sketch-img-resize">
            </a>
            <div class="caption">Initial sketch of Green Cotton; mobile version</div>

            <div class="redirection-section">
                <h2>Redirection</h2>
                <p>While sketching, I quickly realized that the app's typing input function wouldn't be practical for
                    users
                    browsing clothes in-store. Typing in details for every item would be inefficient and could
                    discourage
                    users.</p>
                <p>I almost shelved the idea until one day at a cafe, I saw how easy and fast it was to pull up a menu
                    by
                    scanning a QR code. This inspired me to explore QR codes further and discovered they could link to a
                    wide range of information. This led me back to the drawing board (literally):</p>
                <div class="sketch-margin">
                    <a href="images/greencotton-second-sketch.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery">
                        <img src="images/greencotton/greencotton-second-sketch.jpg" class="sketch-img-resize">
                    </a>
                    <div class="caption">Second sketch of Green Cotton, AR version</div>
                </div>

                While sketching, I also stumbled across the world of AR while researching the technicalities of QR codes
                and
                considered combining AR and QR scanning to make the process more interactive and captivating for
                first-time
                eco-shoppers. With that, I sketched out possible designs for the AR interface that could appeal to
                various
                kinda of eco-shoppers:
                <div class="sketch-margin">
                    <a href="images/greencotton-third-sketch.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery">
                        <img src="images/greencotton/greencotton-third-sketch.jpg" class="sketch-img-resize-2">
                    </a>
                    <div class="caption">Sketches of possible AR interfaces</div>
                </div>

                <p>It was also at this stage where I started thinking about how to display the carbon emissions, water
                    usage, and lifespan of the clothes. I figured that the best way to display the numbers in a way that
                    could allow users to imagine how drastic the enviornmental footprint the clothes they purchase can
                    leave
                    on the enviornment was to compare them to every day items that we interact with frequently, which
                    will
                    be shown later on in the prototype.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <p>After looking for an AR editor, I found Meta Spark Studio to be the best AR program for the prototype
                given my limited resources. Initially, it was challenging, but I adapted quickly due to my previous
                experience with other 3D modeling programs.</p>

            <p>But because of the limited access there was to make and edit my own assets on Meta Spark Studio, I
                figured
                that the best way to make them was on other editing and prototyping platforms and export
                them onto Meta Spark. </p>

            <div class="sketch-margin">
                <p>So first, I made the flat card that would be used as the background of the AR effect on Figma:</p>
                <a href="images/greencotton-figma.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
                    <img src="images/greencotton/greencotton-figma.png" class="sketch-img-resize">
                </a>
                <div class="caption">Card asset made on Figma.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="sketch-margin">
                <p>then the graphics on Illustrator:</p>
                <a href="images/greencotton-illustrator.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
                    <img src="images/greencotton/greencotton-illustrator.png" class="sketch-img-resize">
                </a>
                <div class="caption">Plant and checkmark assets made on Illustrator</div>
            </div>

            <div class="sketch-margin">
                <p>and lastly, I brought in all of the assets into Meta Spark, added the 3D text with their built in
                    text
                    editor, added animations for the assets:</p>
                <a href="images/greencotton-metaspark1.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery">
                    <img src="images/greencotton/greencotton-metaspark1.jpg" class="sketch-img-resize">
                </a>
                <div class="caption">All the assets brought onto Meta Spark. For the purposes of the prototype, the
                    sample
                    image used was a barcode as a temporary placeholder for what would be a QR code.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="sketch-margin">
                <p>and with that, the prototype was complete!</p>
                <a href="images/GreenCottonDemo.mov" data-fancybox="gallery">
                    <video controls class="video-resize" loop>
                        <source src="images/GreenCottonDemo.mov" type="video/mp4">
                        Your browser does not support the video tag.
                    </video>
                </a>
            </div>

            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <p>I tested the prototype with three users and received mostly positive feedback. However, I observed that
                all the users struggled a bit with scanning the barcode. Although they eventually managed to scan it
                without assistance, they mentioned this small issue with the first prototype.</p>
            <p>Additionally, they pointed out that the text was too small and they couldn't zoom into the AR model since
                it was in a fixed position on the QR code.</p>
            <p>To address these concerns, I went back into Meta Spark Studio and made adjustments based on their
                feedback. I resized the QR image to cover the entire tag for easier scanning and increased the size of
                the text and assets for better readability.</p>
            <p>I presented the revised prototype to the same three users, and they all noted that it was easier to scan
                and more readable from a comfortable distance.</p>

        <section id="results">
            <h1 class="project-section-title">✨ Results</h1>
            <p>After completing the development of the AR Green Cotton experience, I eagerly submitted the project to
                an AR experience contest hosted at the Brooklyn Public Library by Jobs For the Future (JFF).

                <b>I am thrilled to announce that the project was selected as one of the 5 winners out of 25 contestants
                    (and I even won a VR headset!)</b> This recognition reaffirmed the effectiveness and innovation of
                my
                design solution in addressing the challenges of sustainable shopping.

            <div class="impact-section">
                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>Winning the contest not only provided validation for my approach but also opened up opportunities for
                    further development and implementation of the AR scanner in UX design.

                    Additionally, <b>I had the honor of being featured on the JFF blog, titled “AR for All: Learner
                        Perspectives on Augmented Reality Training”.</b> The blog advocated for colleges and
                    universities to
                    integrate AR courses and learning into their curriculum, citing my Green Cotton concept as an
                    exemplary
                    case. It's exciting to see my project making waves and inspiring broader conversations about the
                    role of
                    AR in education and sustainability initiatives.</p>

        <section id="reflection">
            <h1 class="project-section-title">🧘🏻‍♀️ Reflection</h1>
            <p>This was my first project working with a medium that was not the traditional mobile device/desktop as a
                UX designer and it opened my eyes to the potential of new technologies and where UX can be involved in
                that. I would definitely want to expand more with AR products in the future, it’s a much more creative way of utilizing Figma and Illustrator. It was
                also interesting to see how integrated these programs are and I would love to implement their
                versatility in the future.</p>
